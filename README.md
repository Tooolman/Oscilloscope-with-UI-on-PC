# Oscilloscope-with-UI-on-PC
EE6008 Project: 
Oscilloscope+Waveform Generator+HardwareControl(PC) / os+sg 412.ipynb are both avaiable as code on PC
final(MC)(Please change the name to 'main').py is code on STM32, or any hardware able to complie micropython.

The given code can achieve an User Interface and simulate a oscilloscope on PC(Jupyter notebook  Strongly Recommended), Please connect 'PA4'  'PA0' 'PA1' to GND  to test the code
